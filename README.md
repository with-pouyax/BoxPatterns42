# RushRectangles
## Introduction
RushRectangles is a C project designed to demonstrate the fundamental capabilities of generating various rectangle patterns in the terminal. This project showcases the use of basic C programming constructs, custom function implementation, and the control of output formatting. The project is structured around the creation of different "rush" functions, each responsible for displaying a unique rectangle pattern based on input dimensions.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following key components:

#### ft_putchar.c:
A utility function to output a single character to the terminal.
#### rush00.c to rush04.c:
Five different files, each containing a specific rush function implementation to draw unique rectangle patterns.
#### main.c:
The main driver code that demonstrates the usage of rush functions.

## Usage
To display a rectangle pattern, execute the compiled binary without any arguments. The current main.c file is configured to display a 5x5 pattern using rush00. To test different patterns and sizes, modify main.c to call the desired rush function with specific dimensions.
